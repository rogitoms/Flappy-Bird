# Flappy-Bird

Flappy Bird  is a browser-based game that challenges players to navigate a bird through a series of moving pipes using simple keyboard controls. Developed using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), the game immerses players in a dynamic environment with smooth animations, realistic physics, and progressively increasing difficulty.

## How to Play
Flappy-Bird is simple yet challenging. The objective is to guide a bird through a series of moving pipes without crashing into them. 
To control the bird:
1. Flap the wings: Press the Spacebar to make the bird fly upward.
2. Gravity: The bird naturally falls due to gravity, so you need to keep flapping to stay in the air.
3. Avoid the pipes: Navigate through the gaps in the pipes without hitting them or the ground.
4. Score points: Each time you successfully pass through a gap, you earn a point.
As you progress, the difficulty increases with faster pipes and narrower gaps, making it more challenging to survive. Try to beat your high score and challenge your friends!

## Features
- **3D Environment**: Enjoy vibrant visuals and interactive scenes created with Three.js.
- **Realistic Gravity Mechanics**: The bird responds to realistic physics, making gameplay more engaging.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: As your score increases, the game becomes more challenging.
- **Collision Detection**: Accurate physics simulation ensures collisions are responsive.
- **Smooth Animations**: Experience seamless movement and transitions for a polished gaming experience.
- **Browser-Based**: Play directly in your web browser without additional installations.

## Gameplay
- **Objective**: Navigate the bird through as many pipes as possible without colliding.
- **Controls**:
  - Press **Spacebar** to flap the birdâ€™s wings.
  - Avoid pipes and the ground to stay alive.
- **Scoring**: Earn points by successfully passing through pipes.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for game logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the game interface.
- **Physics Simulation**: Custom logic for realistic gravity and collision detection.
- **python - pycairo**: to create 2D elements withtin the game
- **Node.js**: used to install and manage three.js and other dependencies, and to run a local server to serve the project files
