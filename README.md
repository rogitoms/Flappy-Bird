# Flappy-Bird

Flappy Bird 3D is a browser-based game that challenges players to navigate a bird through a series of moving pipes using simple keyboard controls. Developed using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), the game immerses players in a dynamic 3D environment with smooth animations, realistic physics, and progressively increasing difficulty.

## How to Play
Flappy Bird 3D is simple yet challenging. The objective is to guide a bird through a series of moving pipes without crashing into them. 
To control the bird:
1. Flap the wings: Press the Spacebar to make the bird fly upward.
2. Gravity: The bird naturally falls due to gravity, so you need to keep flapping to stay in the air.
3. Avoid the pipes: Navigate through the gaps in the pipes without hitting them or the ground.
4. Score points: Each time you successfully pass through a gap, you earn a point.
As you progress, the difficulty increases with faster pipes and narrower gaps, making it more challenging to survive. Try to beat your high score and challenge your friends!
